```

### 2. Verify Tables Created
Check that these tables exist in your Supabase database:
- ✅ `assessment_responses`
- ✅ `ai_results` 
- ✅ `ai_chat_conversations`
- ✅ `telemedicine_sessions`
- ✅ Updated `user_profiles`
- ✅ Updated `appointments`

### 3. Test Row Level Security
All tables have RLS policies that ensure users can only access their own data.

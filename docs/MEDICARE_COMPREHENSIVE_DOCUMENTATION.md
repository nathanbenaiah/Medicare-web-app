## 🚨 The Health Problems We're Fixing

### **What's Wrong with Healthcare in Sri Lanka**

#### **1. Too Long to Wait, Too Hard to Get Help**
**The Problem:**
- **People wait 3-6 hours** at government hospitals and get frustrated
- **Not enough doctors** - we only have 2 doctors for every 1,000 people (should be 4-5)
- **Village areas have fewer doctors** - 60% fewer specialists than in cities
- **Clinics close early** - most only open 8-12 hours per day
- **No easy way to book appointments** - everything is messy and confusing

**What Happens:**
- 4 out of 10 patients give up waiting and go home without getting help
- Emergency patients have to wait with people who just need checkups
- To see a specialist, you have to wait 2-3 months
- People from villages have to travel 3+ hours to see a specialist

#### **2. Too Expensive for Most Families**
**The Problem:**
- **7 out of 10 families** can't afford private doctors regularly
- **Doctor visits cost**: Rs. 2,500-5,000 at private hospitals
- **No insurance**: Only 15 out of 100 families have good health insurance
- **Hidden costs**: Bus fare, missing work, having to visit multiple times

**What Happens:**
- Families wait until they're very sick before getting help
- 1 out of 4 families go broke when someone gets seriously ill
- Small health problems become big expensive diseases
- Children miss school and adults miss work to go to the doctor

#### **3. Dangerous Mistakes and Poor Quality**
**The Problem:**
- **4 out of 10 medicine mistakes** happen because of bad record keeping
- **Everything on paper**: 85 out of 100 health records are still written on paper
- **No checking for dangerous medicine combinations**: Patients often take medicines that fight each other
- **No follow-up**: Different doctors don't talk to each other about patients

**Real Impact:**
- Preventable adverse drug reactions cause 12,000+ hospitalizations annually
- Lost medical records lead to repeated tests and procedures
- Lack of health history increases misdiagnosis risk
- Poor medication adherence worsens chronic conditions

#### **4. Prevention and Early Detection Gaps**
**The Problem:**
- **75% of chronic diseases** caught too late for optimal treatment
- **No systematic health monitoring**: Families don't track health metrics
- **Limited health education**: 60% lack basic health knowledge
- **Reactive healthcare**: System treats illness rather than preventing it

**Real Impact:**
- Diabetes diagnosis often comes after complications develop
- Heart disease detected after first heart attack
- Cancer screening rates below 30% in rural areas
- Preventable deaths from early-stage treatable conditions

#### **5. Rural and Underserved Communities**
**The Problem:**
- **No specialist access**: Rural areas have general practitioners only
- **Transportation challenges**: Nearest hospital 2+ hours away
- **Communication barriers**: Limited access to health information
- **Technology gap**: Poor internet connectivity limits telemedicine

**Real Impact:**
- Rural maternal mortality 3x higher than urban areas
- Chronic disease management nearly impossible
- Emergency response times exceed critical windows
- Young people migrate to cities partly for healthcare access

### **How Much Money We're Wasting**
- **$3.2 billion wasted every year** because our health system doesn't work well
- **Healthcare costs 2.5 times more** than it should because of problems
- **People miss work**: 15 million work days lost every year because of health delays
- **Good doctors leave Sri Lanka**: They go to other countries for better jobs

### **How People Suffer**
- **People die who shouldn't**: 15,000+ people die every year from problems we could have prevented
- **Families worry**: 8 out of 10 families are stressed about healthcare
- **Poor quality of life**: People with long-term diseases don't get proper care
- **Children suffer too**: Kids' health gets worse when families can't get good healthcare
